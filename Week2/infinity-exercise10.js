// We cah store different data types in an array in JS.Here is an example

let myArray = [1,2,3,"one","two",true]

console.log('The values in the array are : ' + myArray)

//  compare infinite. 


let x = 6/0;

let y = 10/0;

if (x === y )
{
    console.log('The two infinities(x and y) are same: ' +x + ' ' + y )
}
else
{
    console.log('The two infinities are different:  ' +x + ' ' + y)
}
